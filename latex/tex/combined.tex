The \texttt{PWM\_0} pin is mapped to an external pin and attached to the charging circuit. The pin \texttt{LED\_0} is attached to a LED through the constraint file, to show when the battery percentage is above 20 \%. The circuit's $V_{ADC1}$ and $V_{ADC2}$ is connected to \texttt{Vaux1} and \texttt{Vaux9}, through a mapping in the constraint file.\\

The block \texttt{pwm\_control\_0} is used as a layer between the PWM module and the reading of PWM command. This module increases, decreases or keeps the duty cycle constant, which is used for the module \texttt{PWM\_{mod}}.
