WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net xadc_pl2ps_i/pwm_control_0/U0/dutyCycleVal_sig_reg[12]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin xadc_pl2ps_i/pwm_control_0/U0/dutyCycleVal_sig_reg[12]_i_1/O, cell xadc_pl2ps_i/pwm_control_0/U0/dutyCycleVal_sig_reg[12]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
